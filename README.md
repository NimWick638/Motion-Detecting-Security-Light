# Motion-Detecting-Security-Light
A motion-triggered security light system using an ESP8266, a PIR motion sensor, and a relay to control a 230V bulb. When motion is detected, the ESP8266 triggers the relay to turn on the light, with adjustable on-time and energy-efficient operation. Ideal for automated security lighting in homes or offices.
